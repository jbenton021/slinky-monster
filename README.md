# Slinky Monster

For this project, I have made what I call a “slinky monster” that rotates around the screen in a goofy way and follows the mouse with its eyes. Its “body” is drawn using a logarithmic spiral from an “origin” line (defined in code by points A and B) to a “destination line” (defined by points C and D).

## Getting Started
